# DS-BIU
Git for Data Science course 858954701

Used Dataset from

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joelmott/flight-delays-dataset

The dataset is over than 25MB therefore we cannot add it to the git.
The file was loaded from the drive in Colab and not locally, so the work will be less time consuming.


## Part 2:
The file's name is BIU-DS-2.ipynb.
We also added requirements.txt to clarify library versions and non-standard libraries, such as holidays.
All the library imports and installations (using pip) are implemented at the beginning of the code for easy installations and imports.

## Final Part:
The file's name is ex4.ipynb.
the adc_X.csv files are required as they are our datasets.
We modified the columns of arr_delay 's in order to match the code.
Instead of working on the departure delays, as we couldn't find sufficient datasets, we decided to work on arrival delays,
the work is pretty much the same work.
